# To-Do List App (CLI · Desktop GUI · Web)

A simple desktop To-Do List application. It allows users to manage their tasks through a user-friendly graphical interface. Users can add, edit, complete, and remove tasks — all saved locally in a `.txt` file.

This repository contains **three versions of the same To-Do List application**, all sharing the same core logic:

1. **Command-line version** (CLI)
2. **Desktop GUI version** (FreeSimpleGUI)
3. **Web version** (Streamlit – deployed)

All three versions reuse the same backend logic (`functions.py`) and persist tasks in `todos.txt`.
